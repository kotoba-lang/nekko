  "The factor a person keeps on paper: 128 bits, written so a human can copy it
  back without the failure mode that makes recovery codes useless.

  That failure mode is worth naming, because it shapes everything here. A
  keyslot answers exactly one question — did this secret open it — and gives
  the same answer for a wrong factor, a tampered slot and a typo. So without a
  checksum a mistyped character is indistinguishable from \"your mailbox is
  gone\", at the worst possible moment, to the least technical user. The check
  character below is not security; it is the difference between \"you typed a
  character wrong\" and a false bereavement.

  Format: Crockford base32, 26 data characters plus one check character,
  grouped in fives.

    K7QM3-XZ9RB-VT2H8-NDJ4P-6WGSY-E

  Crockford rather than plain base32 because it is designed for exactly this:
  I, L and O are not in the alphabet, and on the way back in they are read as
  1, 1 and 0, so the classic transcription confusions decode to the right thing
  instead of failing. Case is ignored; hyphens and spaces are ignored.

  The check character is a position-weighted sum mod 37. Weighted, not a plain
  sum, so that transposing two characters — the other thing people do — does
  not cancel out.

  Portable `.cljc` with no host crypto and no host string classes: only
  `generate` needs randomness and the caller supplies it, so the JVM and the
  browser run this unchanged and tests are deterministic."
