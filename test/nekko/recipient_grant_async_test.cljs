  "Cross-backend contract test: a grant is a grant regardless of which host
  sealed it. Runs under nbb, the one runtime where BOTH backends work -- node
  exposes node:crypto (the sync .cljc branch) and WebCrypto (the async .cljs
  namespace) at the same time, so both directions can be proven in-process
  rather than by eyeballing hex.

  This is the first test of any kind over `nekko.recipient-grant`'s :cljs
  branch: `package.json`'s `test` script is `clojure -M:test`, which only ever
  compiled the :clj side.
